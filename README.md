# Standardised Variant Definitions

This is a repository containing the up-to-date lineage definitions for variants of concern (VOC) and variants of interest (VUI) as curated by Public Health England. They are provided in order to facilitate standardised VOC and VUI calling across sequencing sites and bioinformatics pipelines and are the same definitions used internally at Public Health England.

## File format definition

Each variant is stored one-per-file in the `variant_yaml` directory. Each file should be syntactically correct YAML. The file should be named according to its `unique-id` (unique identifer) with the suffix `.yml`.

You can check that files are correct using the `yaml-validator.py` script.
